2. MK-8237 was being developed as part of a North America partnership with ALK-Abelló (ALK). Merck has given ALK six 

months’ notice that it is terminating the agreement and therefore this compound will be returned to ALK. 
V419, the investigational pediatric hexavalent combination vaccine, DTaP5-IPV-Hib-HepB, is being developed in 
partnership with Sanofi Pasteur and if approved in the US, will be commercialized through that partnership. On 
November 2, 2015, the FDA issued a CRL with respect to V419. The companies are reviewing the CRL and plan to have 
further discussions with the FDA.
